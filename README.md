# Javascript Assessment for NFT Minting

This JavaScript assessment is designed to create a frontend interface for minting non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The interface will allow users to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network, enabling them to mint unique digital assets, such as collectibles, artwork, or game items.

## Description

This project involves developing a JavaScript frontend application that interacts with a Solidity smart contract for NFT minting. The frontend will provide users with a user-friendly interface where they can input necessary information for minting an NFT, such as token metadata or payment details. The application will communicate with the Ethereum blockchain through web3.js or ethers.js, allowing users to mint NFTs directly from their web browsers.
